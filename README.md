This repository contains the implementation of the range-resident logistic model, algonside helper code to run the simulations and reproduce the analyses presented in the accompanying paper.

## Setup

### Clone the repository:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r-menezes/rr-logistic.git
```

### Install dependencies:

#### Option 1: Conda installation

We suggest the use of [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) to manage dependencies. The instructions below are identical if using `conda` instead of `mamba`. To set up the environment:

1.  **Install mamba:** If you don't have conda installed, follow the instructions on the [official mamba website](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).

2.  **Create the environment:** Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal and run:
    
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

    This command reads the `environment.yml` file and installs all the necessary packages (including Python 3.12, numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, palettable, and pyarrow) into a new conda environment named `rr-logistic`.

3.  **Activate the environment:** Before running any scripts, activate the newly created environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate rr-logistic
    ```

4. **Install additional packages:** The package `p_tqdm` has to be installed using `pip`. To install it, run:
    ```bash
    pip install p_tqdm
    ```

Now you have all the required packages installed and can proceed with running the simulations and analyses.

#### Option 2: Pip installation

Alternatively, you can install the required packages using [pip]((https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)). Before running the following command, ensure you have Python 3.12 installed on your system, as well as pip. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the necessary packages (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, palettable, p_tqdm, and pyarrow).

## Reproducing the Figures

To reproduce the figures presented in the paper, simply run the `generate_figs.py` script. This script generates the figures based on the `fig2_dataset.parquet` and `figs34_dataset.parquet` files, which contain the aggregated results from the simulations.

```bash
python generate_figs.py
```

The script will create the figures in the `figs/` directory. The figures are saved in PNG format.

To use different datasets or customize the output directory, you can specify the paths as command-line arguments. The script's help message can be accessed with the `-h` or `--help` flag. By default, the script avoids using LaTeX for rendering the figures. If you want to use LaTeX, you can set the `--tex` flag when running the script. The usage is as follows:

```bash
python generate_figs.py [-h] [--tex] [fig2_dataset] [figs34_dataset] [output]
```

Note that the supplementary figures order is not the same as in the paper.


## Reproducing the Analyses

Follow these steps to reproduce the results:

### Define Experiments:

Create a JSON file (e.g., `experiments.json`) specifying the parameter combinations for your simulations. This will be used by the `experiment_planner` function (part of `run_experiments.py`) to create a full factorial exploration of the parameter space and generate individual parameter files for each simulation run. 

The documentation for the `experiment_planner` is available in the source code. The structure of `experiments.json` should look like this:

```json
{
    "parameter_levels": {
        "tau": [1.0e-06, "..." , 1.0e+00],
        "noise": [],
        "hr_stdev": [0.001, "..." , 1.0],
        "dispersal": [1.0e-03, 1.0e-02, 1.0e-01],
        "comp_kernel": [1.0e-03, 1.0e-02, 1.0e-01],
        "env_size": [1.0],
        "birth_rate": [1.1],
        "death_rate": [0.1],
        "comp_rate": [0.002],
        "steps": [100000],
        "burn_in_steps": [50000],
        "data_interval": [500],
        "max_abundance": [10000],
        "processes_list": [["repr", "death", "compet"]],
        "mover_class": ["OU"],
        "save_temporal_data": [true],
        "save_positions": [false],
        "output_format": ["json"]
    },
    "filtering_parameter": "mover_class",
    "filters": {
        "OU": ["tau", "hr_stdev", "dispersal"],
        "BM": ["noise", "dispersal"],
        "SS": ["dispersal"]
    },
    "common_parameters": ["n_org", "..." ,"output_format"],
    "generate_seeds": true,
    "n_reps": 20,
    "id": "seed",
    "seed": 314159265,
    "filename": "exp_parameters.json"
}
```

The experiment files used to generate the data in the paper are available in the `experiment/` directory. A brief description of each file is provided below:

| File | Description | Figures using the data | # replicas | # simulations |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| `...fig2.json` | Changing `hr_stdev` from $0.001$ to $1.0$ (19 levels) for three levels of `dispersal` ($0.001$, $0.01$, $0.1$) | Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure C.1 | 20 | 1260 |
| `...figs34.json` | Exploring the combinations of `hr_stdev` (from $0.001$ to $1.0$, 49 levels), `tau` (from $10^{-6}$ to $1.0$, 49 levels), `dispersal` ($0.001$, $0.01$, $0.1$), and `comp_kernel` ($0.001$, $0.01$, $0.1$) with a full factorial experiment design. | Figures 3 and 4, Supplementary Figures C.2 and C.5 | 20 | 432180 |
| `...gamma.json` | Changing `hr_stdev` from $0.001$ to $1.0$ (19 levels) for four levels of `dispersal`. Dispersal kernel was set to a gamma distribution with scale parameter $0.01$ and varying shape parameter ($1$, $2$, $4$, $8$)| Supplementary Figure C.3 | 50 | 3800 |

###  Generate Simulation Parameter Files:

Use the `run_experiments.py` script with the `-c` flag to create individual parameter files for each simulation run based on your experiment definition file.

```bash
python run_experiments.py -c -i experiments.json
```
This will generate parameter files (e.g., `exp_parameters.json`) containing the specific parameter combinations for each simulation.

### Run Simulations:

Execute the simulations using the generated parameter files. Run the `run_experiments.py` script with the `-r` flag for each parameter file.

```bash
python run_experiments.py -r -i exp_parameters.json
```
> [!WARNING]  
> Tests on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X show that each simulation step takes 714 microseconds (single core). Thus, a simulation with $10^6$ steps would take approximately 12 minutes on a single core. The 1260 simulations required to generate the data for Figure 2 took 9h to complete when run in parallel using all 24 cores. The simulations required to generate the data for Figures 3 and 4 are estimated to take around 3570 CPU days if run sequentially. Therefore, it is highly recommended to run the simulations in parallel on a high-performance computing cluster.
> 
> Users should adjust the number of steps and repetitions in the `experiments.json` file according to their computational resources and desired accuracy.

### Aggregate Results:

Combine the results from all individual simulations into an aggregated dataset. Run the `run_experiments.py` script with the `-a` flag to aggregate the results, specifying the output directory where the individual results are stored with the `-o` flag.

```bash
python run_experiments.py -a -o path/to/your/output/
```

Replace `path/to/your/output/` with the actual path where the simulation results were saved.
The results can then be used to generate the figures.
